## Ways to contribute

There are numerous ways to contribute to the ongoing development of the Discovery application system.  If you are a software developer we have made it easy to get up and running _(and contributing)_ fast, if you are a user of the application or someone who has ideas that could help us serve our users better we invite filing issues to kickstart a discussion.

<br/>

##### Reporting bugs

If you see something that is not working or makes your life harder, please let us know by filing a bug report in the [GitHub issue queue](https://github.com/PSHCDevOps/discovery/issues).

When describing the issue please be as detailed as possible so we can diagnose the issue easier and provide updates that solve your problem faster.

<br/>

##### Suggesting features

If you have ideas about how Discovery could evolve, we'd love to hear them.  Please file a feature issue in our [GitHub issue queue](https://github.com/PSHCDevOps/discovery/issues) and we will review and potentially prioritize into the development schedule maintained by the Discovery management team.

When submitting a feature request or general improvement be as specific as possible about what is the driving motivation for the improvement.  This will help us understand if the root cause of the feature request could be satisfied by another means if the feature request is architecturally or practically improbable given deadlines and available staffing or budget.

At the very least your feedback can help encourage an open discussion about what Discovery should look like or do.

<br/>

##### Submitting pull requests

The Discovery team is happy to receive your pull requests for updates, but be advised that any pull requests should follow the general conventions of the application and codebase.  Before making a pull request that fundamentally changes the logic of the system it is best to understand the architecture of the system, and be able to navigate a Javascript heavy Django application.

If your pull request does not fit well with the architecture of the Discovery application you may be requested to update parts of the modification to attain alignment.  The maintainers and Discovery management team may or may not integrate pull requests we receive but either way reasoning will be provided to the contributor, as well as any information that would help advance the pull request to proper integration into the codebase.
