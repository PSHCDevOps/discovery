## Overview

The **Discovery** application is built from a collection of manual and automated processes that, when melded together, provide a freely available continuously updating, research tool to the public.  We strive to develop the Discovery application system in the open according to Agile principles, employing DevOps philosophies and methods, and providing a service based on and for the end user through User Centered Design.  In this pursuit we hope to encourage others, both in the government and in the public, to contribute to the endeavor in ways they feel they can make a meaningful contribution.

This Process guide is designed to get you up to speed and provide details on various processes employed in the design, development, testing, and management of the Discovery system online.  If you have any feedback or suggestions for documenting the processes of the Discovery system, we welcome your feedback in the [GitHub issue queue](https://github.com/PSHCDevOps/discovery/issues)!
