## Overview

The **Discovery** application system is a set of components that must work closely together to provide constant data collection and filtered search capabilities to acquisition professionals, government program managers needing professional services, and vendors that provide them.  A foundational understanding of the systems and technologies at work, how they are used, and design principles behind the system will help you get up to speed when working with the Discovery project.

This guide will help you understand the general system architecture, technological components, design philosophies, data management, and asset storage aspects of the Discovery system.  If you have any feedback or suggestions for documenting the architecture and design of the Discovery system, we welcome your feedback in the [GitHub issue queue](https://github.com/PSHCDevOps/discovery/issues)!
